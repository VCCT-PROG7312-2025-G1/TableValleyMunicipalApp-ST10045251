# TableValleyMunicipalApp

## Overview
The Table Valley Municipal App is a cross-platform application built with **Visual Studio** that allows citizens to report municipal issues, track their status in real-time, and receive feedback from municipal staff. It promotes **transparency**, **accountability**, and **citizen engagement** in local governance.

## Features
- **Issue Reporting**: Submit issues with descriptions, categories, and optional documents.
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor the progress of each report from submission to resolution.
- **Feedback Loops**: Communicate with municipal staff for clarifications or updates.
- **Notifications**: Receive alerts when report statuses change.


## How It Works
1. Citizens submit a report via the app.  
2. Reports are stored and assigned a status.  
3. Staff update the status and provide feedback as necessary.  
4. Citizens can track progress and respond to staff updates, creating a transparent two-way communication loop.

## Project Structure
- **Views**: Forms for adding issues, viewing reports, and detailed issue pages.  
- **Models**: Represent issues and users.  
- **Services**: Handle CRUD operations, notifications, and interactions.

## Future Enhancements
- Push notifications for real-time updates.  
- Analytics dashboard for staff.  
- Map view for visualizing issues geographically.  
- Role-based access for staff and admins.
